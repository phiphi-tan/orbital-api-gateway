<h1> [NUS ORBITAL] API Gateway based on CloudWeGo Projects</h1>

by [Phinehas Tan](https://github.com/phiphi-tan/ "also known as Phi Phi") and [Johan Soo](https://github.com/delishad21 "pronounced Yo-han")


**Project Objective**: The primary goal of this project is to implement an API Gateway that accepts HTTP requests encoded in JSON format and uses the Generic-Call feature of Kitex to translate these requests into Thrift binary format requests. The API Gateway will then forward the request to one of the backend RPC servers discovered from the registry center. 

\
**Deliverables**
1. Implement an API Gateway that accepts HTTP requests with JSON encoded bodies.
2. Use the Generic Call feature in Kitex to translate JSON requests into Thrift binary
format.
3. Integrate a load balancing mechanism to distribute requests among backend RPC
servers.
4. Integrate a service registry and discovery mechanism for the API Gateway and RPC
servers.
5. Develop backend RPC servers using Kitex for testing the API Gateway.
6. Document the project, including design decisions, implementation details, and usage
instructions.
